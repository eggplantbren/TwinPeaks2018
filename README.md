# Dependencies

* Python 3 and some packages (Anaconda will do)
* yaml-cpp (https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp)

You can probably get these from your operating system's package manager.
You'll also need the C++ header files, which are sometimes put into a
separate package with the suffix -dev or -devel.

# Compilation

```make```
